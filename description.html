<b>In 1995 a meteor struck down in Italy. From it a formerly unknown </b> <br>
<b>type of crystal grew and quickly spread around the world. The new </b> <br>
<b>substance was named Tiberium, with conflicting sources naming either</b> <br>
<b>the river Tiber or the Roman Emperor Tiberius as its namesake.</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Tiberium growth gathers valuable elements out of the ground and</b> <br>
<b>concentrates them, making the crystals profitable to harvest.</b> <br>
<b>An ancient cult claims the coming of Tiberium had been prohesized.</b> <br>
<b>This organization, known as the Brotherhood of NOD, has secured</b> <br>
<b>some of the richest sources of Tiberium and declared war on the</b> <br>
<b>Global Defense Initiative (GDI), the multinational organization</b> <br>
<b>tasked with securing world peace.</b> <br>
<br>
<b>This is the war for control over Tiberium.</b> <br>
